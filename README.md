# Heretic2

Heretic 2 - Engine Reconstruction Branch:

I have got Heretic 2 running without any closed source bits; I modified the Quake 2 GPL release, to become the "quake2.dll" in Heretic 2. The code changes I made to create the new "quake2.dll" foundation aren't made hap hazzardly; I have mapped enough functions in quake2.dll and was able to use hex rays to help me make the needed code modifications to get this far.

I have got the foundation on its feet, just a few big things are left:

1) 3rd person camera has to be re-created.
2) Player pmove needs to be re-written based on the hex rays output ofï»¿ the original Quake2.dll.
3) Client effects need to be hooked up the network replication.
4) Minor things like obituary notifications and such.
5) Some server side support functions.

To run:
Simply copy over the base data to the root folder here, you don't need any of the original binaries.
